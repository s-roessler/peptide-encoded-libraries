# peptide-encoded-libraries
Peptide-encoded libraries (PELs) leverage peptides as carriers of information for the encoding of appendant small molecules and can be used for the discovery of ligands with affinity for therapeutic targets of interest using affinity selection followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The files in this repository facilitate the PEL workflow. The data presented herein is part of the initial PEL report (doi: 10.1126/science.adf1354) which details the experimental set-up and should be cited in all uses.
