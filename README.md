# peptide-encoded-libraries
Peptide-encoded libraries (PELs) leverage peptides as carriers of information for the encoding of appendant small molecules and can be used for the discovery of ligands with affinity for therapeutic targets of interest using affinity selection followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The files in this repository facilitate the PEL workflow.
